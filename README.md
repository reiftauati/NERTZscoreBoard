NERTZ is another silly game we play. 
I really suck at this game, and its pretty bad 
telling the score keeper your score at the end of each
game, so I decided to become the score keeper.

...if I'm the score keeper, then I'm going to write some code 
to get it done for me. 

Hence: the NERTZ scoreboard.

Unlimited players, unlimited rounds, cool celebrations for the winner,
eternal shame for the last placed guy (which was often me). 

Enjoy it if you hate keeping score. :)
(hey bebs, ily)

-PS: it even keeps the same players if you want to play again. +2 brownie points.
